1. Open cockatrice, oracle should run. If it doesn't, go to **Help** > **Check for Card Updates**, this will run oracle.
2. In oracle, in the first window (for cards), input https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiwow7/Voyager/refs/heads/main/tricedata/cards.xml

4. Go to **Cockatrice** > **Settings** > **Card Sources**. Use the **-** button to delete all the other card sources. Use the **+** button and add the following URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uiwow7/Voyager/refs/heads/main/tricedata/pics/!setcode!/!name!.jpg
